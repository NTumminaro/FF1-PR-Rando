# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on stabilizing and validating the core logic of the FF1 randomizer, particularly around crystal key items, map events, and cosmetic flags. The goal is to ensure all existing functionality works reliably before adding new features. The randomizer works by modifying CSV files and map content, placing them in a mods folder for consumption by a separate mod that must be pre-installed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a randomizer user, I want crystal key items to work without causing game crashes or freezes, so that I can complete randomized playthroughs reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a crystal is obtained as a key item THEN the game SHALL continue without freezing or crashing
2. WHEN crystal key item logic is triggered THEN all related map events SHALL execute properly
3. WHEN crystal progression is checked THEN the game state SHALL remain consistent
4. IF crystal key item acquisition fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error handling

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a randomizer user, I want map calls and events to work correctly with crystal logic, so that game progression remains functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN crystal-related events are added to maps THEN they SHALL integrate properly with existing map logic
2. WHEN map events reference crystal key items THEN the references SHALL be valid and functional
3. WHEN crystal logic modifies map behavior THEN the modifications SHALL not conflict with other map elements
4. IF map event integration fails THEN the system SHALL log appropriate error information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a randomizer developer, I want all cosmetic flags to work consistently, so that visual customizations apply reliably across the game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cosmetic flags are enabled THEN they SHALL apply consistently across all relevant game elements
2. WHEN multiple cosmetic flags are active THEN they SHALL not conflict with each other
3. WHEN cosmetic changes are applied THEN they SHALL not interfere with core game logic
4. IF cosmetic flag application fails THEN the system SHALL fall back gracefully without affecting gameplay

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a randomizer developer, I want the overall randomizer logic to be sound and consistent, so that all features work reliably together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN randomization is performed THEN all generated content SHALL be valid and consistent
2. WHEN different randomization options are combined THEN they SHALL not create conflicting modifications
3. WHEN the randomizer generates mod files THEN they SHALL be properly formatted for the target mod system
4. IF logic conflicts are detected THEN the system SHALL provide clear warnings or error messages
5. WHEN randomization completes THEN all output files SHALL be validated for correctness

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a randomizer developer, I want all data files and hard-coded logic to be correct and properly referenced, so that the randomizer uses accurate information for all operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the randomizer references map data THEN it SHALL use the correct files for both randomizer-specific and vanilla content
2. WHEN hard-coded logic is executed THEN it SHALL reference the appropriate data files and map configurations
3. WHEN data files are loaded THEN the system SHALL validate that they contain expected content and structure
4. WHEN vanilla files are used alongside randomizer modifications THEN they SHALL be properly integrated without conflicts
5. IF data file references are incorrect THEN the system SHALL detect and report the discrepancies

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a randomizer user, I want clear feedback when issues occur, so that I can understand and resolve problems with my randomized game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur during randomization THEN the system SHALL provide descriptive error messages
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL indicate which specific elements failed validation
3. WHEN the randomizer encounters unexpected conditions THEN it SHALL log detailed diagnostic information
4. IF critical errors prevent randomization completion THEN the system SHALL clearly communicate the failure reason
